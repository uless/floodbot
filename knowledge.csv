information,"If you are a disaster survivor, visit FEMA.gov for up-to-date disaster information. For questions about disaster assistance applications, call (800) 621-3362, visit disasterassistance.gov, or use the FEMA mobile app."
flood,"Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto normally dry land. Floods are the most common disaster in the U.S. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death. Floods may result from rain, snow, coastal storms, storm surges, and overflows of dams and water systems. They can develop slowly or quickly, sometimes with no warning. Floods can cause outages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings, and create landslides. Know your flood zone and follow official evacuation routes. Do not drive through flooded roads during evacuation."
safe,"Find safe shelter immediately. Do not walk, swim, or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown! Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot can sweep your vehicle away. Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Keep important documents in a waterproof container. Create password-protected digital copies.
Do not touch electrical equipment if wet or standing in water. Turn off electricity if safe to do so.
Use generators and gasoline-powered machinery outdoors and away from windows to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning."
evacuate,"If under a flood warning, evacuate if told to do so, move to higher ground or a higher floor, or stay where you are, depending on the situation. Evacuate immediately if ordered. Never drive around barricades. Contact your healthcare provider if sick and shelter in place when necessary. Listen to emergency alerts for instructions.
Do not walk, swim, or drive through floodwaters. Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. If trapped in a car, stay inside. If water is rising inside, get on the roof.
If experiencing flooding, move to higher ground or the highest level of a building. Do not shelter in a basement or any room with submerged electrical lines. Avoid closed attics, as they may trap you. Only go to the roof if necessary and signal for help.
Evacuate immediately when ordered to do so. Failing to evacuate in time increases the risk of injury or death.
Decide how to evacuate—personal vehicle, public transport, or riding with others. Confirm public transit details in advance.
Take critical supplies and documents with you, including medications, identification, and emergency kits.
Timely evacuations save lives. Moving people out of harm’s way significantly reduces flood-related deaths.
People in high-risk zones should evacuate when instructed. Staying behind increases risk to both individuals and emergency responders."
risk,"Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center to understand flood risks in your area. Flooding doesn’t follow map lines—where it rains, it can flood. Sign up for community warnings. The National Risk Index shows which communities are most at risk for flooding. Pay attention to local officials and evacuate flooded areas. Entering floodwaters could result in injury or death.
Flooding is the most common natural disaster worldwide and can occur anywhere in the U.S. and its territories.
Rapidly rising water is especially hazardous as people may be trapped in lower floors with little time to evacuate. The combination of rapid water rise and deep water poses additional risks.
Basements and underground spaces are highly dangerous in floods. Rising water can create hydrostatic pressure, making it impossible to open doors. Past disasters have shown high fatalities in flooded basements and underground locations.
More flood-related deaths occur due to driving into floodwaters than any other cause. It only takes 12 inches of rushing water to carry away most cars, and 2 feet can move SUVs and trucks.
Approximately 75% of flash flood deaths occur at night, and half of victims are inside vehicles. Many deaths happen when people drive around barricades."
money,"Move valuables to higher levels, declutter drains and gutters, install check valves, and consider a sump pump with a battery backup. Federal disaster aid requires a presidential declaration and is usually in the form of loans that must be repaid. Purchase or renew flood insurance. Homeowner’s insurance does not cover flooding. It typically takes up to 30 days for a policy to take effect. Get flood coverage under NFIP.  Flood insurance covers up to $250,000 for residential property and $100,000 for personal belongings. Even in moderate-risk areas, flood insurance is available at lower rates, sometimes as low as $325 per year."
prepare,"Make a household plan, including pets. Learn evacuation routes and shelter plans. Gather supplies such as non-perishable food, cleaning supplies, and water in case of emergency."
house,"If trapped in a building, move to the highest level. Only go to the roof if necessary and signal for help. Do not climb into a closed attic, as rising water can trap you. Protect your home by elevating utilities, using sandbags, and installing a battery-operated sump pump. Most homeowners' insurance does not cover flooding. Only flood insurance provides financial recovery."
return,Follow authorities' instructions and return home only when it is safe. Avoid driving except in emergencies. Wear protective gear for cleanup. People with respiratory conditions should avoid areas with mold exposure.
animal,Be aware of potential animal hazards like snakes inside buildings after flooding.
water,Avoid wading in floodwaters as they may be contaminated and contain debris. Downed power lines can electrify water.
alert,"Sign up for emergency alerts from local agencies. Know what alerts mean before a flood occurs. Warnings and evacuations are key factors in reducing loss of life. Even with little time, a warning allows people to find safer shelter."
emergency,"Have food, water, and emergency supplies for several days. Consider medication, batteries, and phone chargers."
drive,"Do not drive into underground roads or tunnels during a flood. Roads may be unsafe due to damage. Do not attempt to cross floodwaters. Turn around, don’t drown! Floodwaters may obscure road conditions, and even a foot of moving water can sweep a vehicle away. Never drive around barriers blocking flooded roads. Do not drive into underground roads or tunnels during a flood. These areas can fill quickly, trapping occupants inside vehicles. If floodwaters rapidly rise around your vehicle, exit immediately and seek higher ground. If water is rising inside, climb onto the roof and signal for help. Stay inside if swept away by strong currents. People often underestimate the risk of driving through floodwaters. Vehicles, especially SUVs and trucks, can float in just two feet of water. Studies show that 63% of flood-related fatalities with known locations occur in vehicles. Texas alone averages 15 vehicle-related drowning deaths per year due to flooded roads. Over half of U.S. flood fatalities involve people driving into floodwaters, either drowning in vehicles or perishing after escape."
return,"Return only when officials say it is safe. Check drinking water safety with local health authorities. Return only when officials say it is safe. Check drinking water safety with local health authorities.
Floodwaters can contain sharp objects, sewage, bacteria, and hazardous chemicals. Avoid contact."
return,"Floodwaters can contain sharp objects, sewage, bacteria, and hazardous chemicals. Avoid contact."
poison,Use generators outdoors and at least 20 feet away from windows and doors to prevent poisoning.
shelter,"Know the risks of sheltering in place during a flood. Factors such as floodwater depth, rise rate, structural integrity of the shelter, and the ability to evacuate to higher levels influence safety. The stability of a shelter during a flood is a key factor in survival. Buildings with weak structures or poor compliance with building codes may not be safe for shelter-in-place strategies."
strategy,"Vertical protection strategies involve moving to higher elevation within a threatened area. These strategies are effective for hazards with short warnings, using natural (hills, trees) or manmade structures (multi-story buildings, vertical shelters). Some self-protective behaviors during floods include moving to rooftops, climbing trees, or seeking higher ground. Reports from past disasters show these behaviors have helped people survive."
disability,"Sheltering in place may be unsuitable for people with limited mobility, disabilities, or medical conditions requiring ongoing care."
electricity,Standing water near electrical lines or equipment is dangerous. Electrical injuries may occur due to flooding.
case,"During Hurricane Katrina, many tourists evacuated vertically to high-rise hotels in New Orleans due to canceled flights and lack of transportation. The hurricane caused around 1,100 deaths, with many fatalities due to drowning and entrapment in attics. In North Carolina during Hurricane Floyd (1999), 82.5% of flood-related vehicle crashes were caused by hitting floodwater, leading to 14 fatalities."
vehicle,"Vehicles can lose stability during floods due to buoyancy and sliding. Floodwaters can turn vehicles into dangerous debris, increasing damage to buildings and blocking critical infrastructure like bridges. The two main ways vehicles lose stability in a flood are floating (when buoyancy overcomes weight) and sliding (when water drag reduces tire traction). Once a vehicle starts floating, it becomes uncontrollable."
urban,"Urban flooding can make nearly all main roads impassable for vehicles. During the 2021 Zhengzhou flood in China, modeling showed extreme flood risks for vehicles, highlighting the need to abandon vehicles and escape to safety."
pet,"Plan where you will evacuate—family, friends, hotels, or public shelters. Ensure the destination accommodates all household members, including pets and individuals with special needs."
live,"Plan where you will evacuate—family, friends, hotels, or public shelters. Ensure the destination accommodates all household members, including pets and individuals with special needs."
death,"Slow-onset floods have lower mortality rates, while flash floods have much higher death rates, comparable to earthquakes and windstorms. Most flash flood fatalities (75.7%) occur when people enter floodwaters in vehicles or on foot for various reasons, including evacuation and work."
